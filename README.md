## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- Grid

### What I learned

I set up this project without using create-react-app, to get a better overview of how react works, following this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB1TKceLzh0

### Continued development

In future projects I want to become more comfortable with using react.js and scss, because I think both give you a better readability of your code and prevent code-repetition.
